## 👋 Hi there - I'm Ethan Neil 

I am an associate professor of physics at the [University of Colorado, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/physics) 🦬.  My work
focuses on theoretical particle physics, with an emphasis on strongly-interacting systems like quantum chromodynamics.  These
systems are difficult to solve by hand, so I use large-scale computing for my research (mainly lattice gauge theory.)

### ⚛️ Research 

You can find my published work through my author pages:

- [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1044880?ui-citation-summary=true)
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sNpQ-dgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

### 🎓 Teaching

Some of my lecture notes are available as GitHub Pages:

- [Classical mechanics](https://etneil.github.io/phys2210_lec_notes) (PHYS 2210)
- [Graduate quantum mechanics](https://etneil.github.io/grad_qm_lec_notes) (PHYS 5250 and 5260)

My lecture notes are authored using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).  I wrote some older sets of lecture notes that were hosted at CU
on a server which is no longer avaiable; I am hoping to translate them into Quarto and post them here eventually!

### 🏔️ TASI

I am the local co-director of the [Theoretical Advanced Summer Institute](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/TASI/Program-Overview) (TASI) summer school,
held every June on the CU Boulder campus for advanced particle theory graduate students from around the world.
